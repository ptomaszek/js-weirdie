## Development 

### Adding a weirdness 

1. Go to the [weirdnesses](weirdnesses) folder
1. Follow the naming convenction and create the script and expected output

#### Restrictions:

1. One expression per line, e.g. if writing a function it must be a one-liner: `function dis() { return this; }`
1. `printThis()` must be the only function in a line


### Adding a library 

By hand or with the help of `node` and `yarn`:

1. Install node and yarn
1. Type:
   ```
   yarn add <lib>
   yarn install
   gulp
   ```
