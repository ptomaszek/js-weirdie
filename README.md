## Development - adding a weirdness 

1. Go to the [weirdnesses](weirdnesses) folder
1. Follow the naming convenction and create the script and expected output

#### TIPS:

1. Put only one expression in a line, e.g. if using a function it must be a one-liner: `function dis() { return this; }`
1. `printThis()` must be the only function in a line
